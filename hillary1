{"text": "Have you not figured it out yet? All the scumbags are 33rd degree Freemasons!\nHowever,\n lower level Freemasons have no idea what they are actually involved in.\n Deception, compartmentalization, secrecy and cunning subtleties are the\n lures into the brotherhood of the serpent. If they knew that \nFreemasonry is an ancient Luciferian Cult run by the Jesuits, they would\n probably never have joined in the first place. Deceit and slight of \nhand can mislead the most trusting souls.\nMany high ranking Nazi's \nwere a 33rd degree mason, Mengele 33rd, Himmler and Goobbels both \nJesuits and many others, oddly enough so was Churchill, Roosevelt and \nTrueman; they control all sides, using thesis - antithesis to manipulate\n the entire world to their will! Hitler said, \"I learned much from the \norder of the Jesuits....Until now there has never been anything more \ngrandiose, on earth, than the hierarchical system of the catholic \nchurch\", (the HEAD of the Jesuit/Freemason kabal). \"I transferred much \nof this organization into my own party\". The Papacy was taken over by \nNapoleon, 33rd degree Mason, and then resurrected under the Jesuit \norder, which controls Freemasonry; the Papacy is the BEAST that suffered\n a deadly wound but was healed and came back to life. Every world leader\n is a high ranking Freemason directly or indirectly through other secret\n societies. All members of the royal family are 33rd degree Freemasons, \nTony Blair, 33rd degree, Al Gore 33rd, Dick Chainey 33rd, Jimmy Carter \n33rd, Gerhard Schroeder 33rd, Mandela 33rd, Astor, Du Pont, Harriman, \nRussel, Bundy, Habsburg, Freeman, Dole, Kemp, Gingrich, Helms, \nGoldwater, Washington, Polk, Jackson, Monroe, Buchanan, Johnson, \nGarfield, McKinley, both - Roosevelt, Taft,\u00a0 Thurmond, Powell, Teng-hui,\n Greenspan, Rockefeller, Harding, Trueman, Bacon, Walt Disney, Owen, \nMitchel, Grissom,\u00a0 Rothchild, Wallenberg, Rhodes, Engels, Chamberlain, \nHoover, Marx, Stalin, Trotsky, Kohl, Mitterand, Rabin, Arafat, Peres, \nReagan, Ford, Netanyahu, Gorbachev, Hussein, all 33rd degree Freemasons \nand or related brotherhoods of the serpent, Napoleon, 33rd degree, Bill \nClinton, 33rd, Bushes, 33rd, Hillery, 6\" Grand Dame mason, Billy Graham,\n 33rd degree mason, Robert Schuller, 33rd degree mason, the Pope, 33rd \ndegree mason, all top Hollywood stars, Masons, all top music stars, \nmasons, most of the televangelists, 33rd degree masons and the list goes\n on and on and on. Are we beginning to see a pattern here? The \nFreemasons are a luciferian cult and together with the Jesuits in an \nalliance from Hell, their goal is a one world government ruled by \nFreemasonic principles and dogma, the rule of law as Bush senior put it,\n their new world order under their god, Lucifer. The statue of Liberty \nis actually Lucifer carrying the shinning light of forbidden knowledge \nto mankind; Lucifer can be portrayed as either male or female, the \nduality of Pan. Their teaching is in every school but you don't see it \nbecause you do not know it is there.\nRound up all Freemasons and all\n secret society members and lock them all away in a very dark place. All\n governments are part of a worldwide Freemason/Jesuit kabal that is \nactually a luciferian cult. The main center is the Vatican with its \nidolatry and repetitious religious dogma always moving toward a one \nworld religion and the implementation of the rule of law, not GOD's LAW \nbut the laws of men as dictated by Freemasonry, is done through the \nUnited Nations arm of this luciferian cult. The Pope is a 33rd degree \nFreemason/Jesuit and what the church teaches is Freemasonry, the \ndoctrine of lucifer, disguised as Christianity. Did you know that? Every\n single top member, EVERY world leader, of EVERY government, religion, \nthe space program requires members to be Freemasons, public and private \neducation facilities, military, all throughout the legal system at each \nlevel, are high ranking masons, most are 33rd degree Freemasons. Every \ndamned one of the men and woman that run the world are the servants of \nthe devil just as GOD said this world belongs to the father of all lies.\n Hitlery Clinton is a 6\" Grand Dame Mason; that is why she is not in \nprison. They all work together in unison toward their new world order \ngoal and have done this for centuries. What? Did you think this is \nsomething new? This goes all the way back to the fallen angels and what \nthey taught to men. All countries are formed and based in the lucifarian\n Freemason ideology. All wars are orchestrated and all social division \nand religion is part of the scheme; after all a slave unaware that they \nare a slave, will not revolt. You and your family will be rounded up and\n killed within a few short years if you allow these people to get their \nway. Everything is a two faced lie.\n\nPotato, potato, tomato, \ntomato as the saying goes. Illuminati members are also Freemasons as a \nrule. History and deep research shows a Jesuit/Freemason alliance that \nis the hand behind all other secret societies. They are kabalists and \nthey work with the numbers and crafts taught to men and women so long \nago now by the fallen and their children. This is all very real; it is \nnot some story or fairy-tail. You can think of Freemasonry as the \nteaching of the fallen angels. That is what it is, the 7 liberal arts \nand the rule of Freemasonic law. These people are literally the worst \nenemies of GOD and mankind, HIS creation. Look around you, they are \ndestroying everything, water, earth, air, health, the family, creating \ndivision between groups of people for any reason they can sell, creating\n a dependent society, (FEW OR NO JOBS), with the loss of the ability to \ncare for yourself and your family, and devastating any hope they can \nwith fear mongering and desperation peddling.

If you lose your job; you are on your own, there are no jobs to hold on to because you & Obama took our jobs abroad; so you are on your own. If your aging parents can't afford health care; you are on your own, thank you Hillary for clarifying that, ever since you and Obama came into office, we Americans considered ourselves \"on our own\". Some of us are very lucky to have a low paying job, but we consider ourselves; on our own because the establishment forgot about us and left us \"on our own\". So now you are gasping for air and you will say and do anything for a Vote and you will throw anyone under the bus to WIN. Hillary when you tell the American people that we are deplorable, it is only a mere reflection of what you created. You are a very despised and deplorable human being, we don't forget and forgive easily Hillary. We don't have the privilege of being in your seat, we don't have millions of dollars linen our pockets like you do, so when you say job security, you have no idea what work is, you have never held an honest job in your life, and by the way our traitorous president has never fought for us, he has mockingly acknowledge us as Lazy Americans, just like you say that we a deplorable and despisable Americans. There is nothing that you can say or do to change us now, it is to little to late to try to change our hearts. Our cuts are deep, but you have finally nifed us in the back.

Obama has instilled that in us for 8 yrs ..What the world thinks of us.\n\nI don't care if he has a barb wire fence a quarter of mile thick or a ditch or\u00a0 or electronic surveillance or a combination of all\u00a0or wall.\n\nthere are more than likely closer to 20 million illegals and about half are not from Mexico but from countries where they overstayed their green card visas....If Trump fines anyone who hires illegals .. many will return to where they belong.

{"text": "First off, I'm sure by \"media/press items inaccurate,\" you mean that I don't get my news from paranoid conspiracy sites that believe \"globalism\" is going to take over the world.\n\n\"What others think of us\" is important. Our country heavily depends upon foreign relations. Alliances and agreements with other countries are how America has been able to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons, combat ISIS (which is not going to be done by alienating Muslims with Islamophobic rhetoric and making unsubstantiated claims about terrorists infiltrating the US through our immigration system), or establish a system of free trade that has been able to benefit everyone.\n\nElecting a demagogue like Trump will devastate our national image that has just started to recover from the disastrous years of Dubya. People hate him. Britain seriously considered banning him from entering the country. 89% of Germans have no confidence in him, along with 92% of Swedes and 80% of Canadians. Even Boris Johnson despises him.\n\nAnd you seem to think that we've been putting America last, which is ridiculous. America has always been pursuing its interests. It's why we've imposed massive restrictions on Iran's nuclear programs to stop them from obtaining the Uranium needed for nuclear weapons. It's why we're working with a coalition to defeat ISIS. It's why we've been creating trade agreements that benefit the US.\n\nIt's just that it's not as easy or as simple as you may think. Illegal immigration can't be solved with walls. Terrorism can't be fixed by stopping immigration (the vast majority of terrorists in America are born in the United States). Solutions to these problems are more complex than that.\n\nAnd that's the problem with Donald Trump. He offers solutions that are appealing, but unrealistic. It feels good to hear that he's going to build a wall to stop immigrants from coming in. It feels good to hear that he's going to deport all of the undocumented immigrants. It feels good to hear that he's going to stop people from immigrating from countries in the Middle East. It feels good to hear that these things are going to solve all of your problems. But they're not going to work. His attempts to try to implement these (if Congress is even going to allow him to) are going to be catastrophic for the US. There's a reason why he has been rated as the sixth greatest threat to the global economy; it's because his policies aren't going to fix anything.\ufeff", "time": "1 day ago", "author": "smapho123", "cid": "z13dgtewzlbgj33ta22fypkz0yqyufazw04.1474077384335086"}
